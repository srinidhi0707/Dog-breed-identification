# Dog Breed Classifier with Heroku deployment
[![TensorFlow 2.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/TensorFlow-2.3-FF6F00?logo=tensorflow)](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.0)
[![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.6-3776AB)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)<br>

This is a project which detects 30 different dog breeds.

### Key features are :

<ul>
  <li> This model is trained on Tensorflow 2.3.0 object classification.</li>
  <li> To train the model, famous <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data">Kaggle Dataset</a> which consists of 120 different breeds, out of which 30 famous breeds were taken for simplicity.</li>
  <li> Took nearly 2.5k images of 30 breeds.</li>
  <li> For training,<b>Inception v3</b> model as base model is used for feature extraction.</li>
  <li> After training, training accuracy reached <b>99%</b> with testing accuracy nearing <b>94%.</b></li>
  <li> Deployed the model with python and having <b>'Flask'</b> as backend and <b>'gunicorn'</b> as server.</li>
</ul>
